Simple example to demonstrate programming to interface 

Always *program for interface and not for implementation* this will lead to flexible code which can work with any new implementation of interface. So use interface type on variables, return types of method or argument type of methods in Java. This has been advised by many Java programmer including in **Effective Java** and **Head First Design Pattern** books.
